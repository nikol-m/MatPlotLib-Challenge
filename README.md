# MatPlotLib-Challenge

Analysis

Based on the data below, the following conclusions were made:
- Most mice were treated with Capomulin and Ramicane, which were also the most successful treatments.
- The correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume is 0.84, which is a strong positive correlation.
- The correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume is 0.95, which is a strong positive correlation.
- Propriva was the least successful treatment because it was the least frequently tested
- There mice test subjects were both male and females and there was almost an equal split between the two
  sexes.
- Infubinol was the only treatment that had an outlier.
- The average tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin and Ramicane was lower than the average tumor volume for    mice treated with Infubinol and Ceftamin.

What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?

In this assignment, you’ll apply what you've learned about Matplotlib to a real-world situation and dataset.

Background
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.
